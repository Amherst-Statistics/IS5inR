## Introduction and background 

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Fifth Edition of *Intro Stats* (2018) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock.
More information about the book can be found at http://wps.aw.com/aw_deveaux_stats_series.  This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).  A paper describing the mosaic approach was published in t
he *R Journal*: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024.

## Chapter 4: Understanding and Comparing Distributions

```{r}
library(mosaic)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
HopkinsForest <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Hopkins_Forest.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
gf_histogram(~ avg_wind_mph, data = HopkinsForest)
favstats(~ avg_wind_mph, data = HopkinsForest)
```

### Section 4.1: Displays for Comparing Groups

#### Histograms

```{r}
HopkinsForest <- HopkinsForest %>%
  mutate(catmonth = ifelse(month <= 9 & month >= 4, "Spring/Summer", "Fall/Winter"))
gf_histogram(~ avg_wind_mph, data = HopkinsForest) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap(~ catmonth)
favstats(~ avg_wind_mph | catmonth, data = HopkinsForest)
```

#### Example 4.1: Comparing Groups with Stem-And-Leaf

```{r}
NestEgg <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Nest_Egg_Index.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
with(NestEgg, stem(nest_egg_index)) # not sure how to group by region
```

#### Boxplots

```{r}
gf_boxplot(avg_wind_mph ~ 1, data = HopkinsForest, xlab = "")
gf_boxplot(avg_wind_mph ~ as.factor(month), data = HopkinsForest) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "month", y = "average wind speed (mph)")
```

#### Example 4.2: Comparing Groups with Boxplots

```{r}
Coasters <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Coasters_2015.csv")
gf_boxplot(Speed ~ Track, data = Coasters)
```

#### Step-By-Step Example: Comparing Groups

```{r}
Cups <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Cups.csv")
favstats(~ Difference | Container, data = Cups)
gf_boxplot(Difference ~ Container, data = Cups) 
```

#### Just Checking

```{r, warning=FALSE}
Flights <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Flights_on_time_2016.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
gf_histogram(~ ontime_pct, data = Flights, binwidth = 2, ylab = "# of Months", xlab = "Ontime %")
gf_boxplot(ontime_pct ~ 1, data = Flights, xlab = "")
gf_boxplot(ontime_pct ~ month, data = Flights)
```

#### Random Matters

```{r}
CarSpeeds <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Car_speeds.csv")
gf_boxplot(speed ~ direction, data = CarSpeeds)
```

See histogram on page 103.  

### Section 4.2: Outliers

```{r}
gf_boxplot(avg_wind_mph ~ as.factor(month), data = HopkinsForest) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Month", y = "Average Wind Speed (mph)")
```

#### Example 4.3: Checking Out the Outliers

```{r}
gf_boxplot(Speed ~ Track, data = Coasters)
```

### Section 4.3: Re-Expressing Data: A First Look

#### Re-Expressing to Improve Symmetry

```{r}
CEOComp <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/CEO_Compensation_2014.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
gf_histogram(~ ceo_compensation_m, xlab = "Compensation (M$)", ylab = "Millions of $", 
             data = CEOComp)
gf_boxplot(ceo_compensation_m ~ 1, xlab = "Compensation (M$)", ylab = "Millions of $", 
           data = CEOComp)
gf_histogram(~ log(ceo_compensation_m), xlab = "Log (compensation)", ylab = "# of CEOs", 
             data = CEOComp)
```

#### Re-Expression to Equalize Spread Across Groups

```{r}
PassiveSmoke <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Passive_smoke.csv")
gf_boxplot(cotinine ~ smoke_exposure, ylab = "Cotinine (ng/ml)", xlab = "Smoke Exposure", 
           data = PassiveSmoke)
gf_boxplot(log(cotinine) ~ smoke_exposure, ylab = "Log(cotinine)", xlab = "Smoke Exposure", 
           data = PassiveSmoke)
```
