## Introduction and background 

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Fifth Edition of *Intro Stats* (2018) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock.
More information about the book can be found at http://wps.aw.com/aw_deveaux_stats_series.  This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).  A paper describing the mosaic approach was published in the *R Journal*: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024.

### Section 17.1: A Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Proportions

XX NH need seatbelts data and online profiles data

### Section 17.2: Assumptions and Conditions for Comparing Proportions

### Section 17.3: The Two-Sample *z*-Test: Testing for the Difference Between Proportions

XX NH need sleep data

### Section 17.4: A Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Means

### Section 17.5: The Two-Sample *t*-Test: Testing for the Difference Between Two Means

#### Step-By-Step Example: A Two-Sample *t*-Test for the Difference Between the Two Means

```{r}
BuyingCam <- read_csv("http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/is5/data/Buy_from_a_friend.csv")
```

By default, `read_csv()` prints the variable names. These messages can be suppressed using the `message=FALSE` code chunk option to save space and improve readability. 

### Section 17.6: Randomization Tests and Confidence Intervals for Two Means

### Section 17.7: Pooling

### Section 17.8: The Standard Deviation of a Difference
